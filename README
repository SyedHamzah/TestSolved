INTRODUCTION
	
	The OddsConverter module provides subroutines to calculate Decmial Odds and Return On Investment associated with a bet, based on a probablity value. 

INPUT VALIDATION

	The OddsConverter Module takes anonymous hash that has probability value.
	It executes checks against that value and dies if its not a valid probability value.

FORMULA FOR CALCULATION

	Decimal Odds = 1/Probability
	ROI = [(1/Probability) - 1 ] * 100 %

OBJECT DEFINITION

	The object of this class is a hash reference that contains the probability value.

SUB-ROUTINES

	decimal_odds : Returns the calculated decimal odds based on the above mentioned formula. Takes the probablity value from the object with which the subroutine is called.
	roi : Returns the calculated return on investment based on the above mentioned formula. Takes the probablity value from the object with which the subroutine is called.
